# WALMARTLABS 2018
In this tiny project, I showed two showcase for WalmartLabs using Python based on Scikit-Learn framework as belows:
* [Predict Server Power using Linear Regression](predict_server_power.ipynb) 
* [Predict Disk Failure using Logistic Regression](predict_disk_failure.ipynb)

My results are as good as Splunk Machine Learning framework in these two examples.
